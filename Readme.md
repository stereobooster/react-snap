# react-snap [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-snap.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snap) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/react-snap.svg) [![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social&label=Follow)](https://twitter.com/stereobooster)

Pre-renders web app into static HTML. Uses headless chrome to crawl all available links starting from the root. Heavily inspired by [prep](https://github.com/graphcool/prep) and [react-snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot), but written from scratch. Uses best practices to get best loading performance.

## Features

- Enables **SEO** (google, duckduckgo...) and **SMO** (twitter, facebook...) for SPA.
- **Works out-of-the-box** with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) - no code-changes required.
- Uses **real browser** behind the scene, so no issue with unsupported HTML5 features, like WebGL or Blobs.
- Does a lot of load **performance optimization**. [Here are details](doc/load-performance-optimizations.md), if you are curious.
- **Does not depend on React**. The name is inspired by `react-snapshot`. Works with any technology.
- npm package does not have compilation step, so **you can fork** it, change what you need and install it with GitHub URL.

**Zero configuration** is the main feature. You do not need to worry how does it work or how to configure it. But if you are curious [here are details](doc/behind-the-scenes.md).

## Basic usage with create-react-app

Install:

```sh
yarn add --dev react-snap
```

Change `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "postbuild": "react-snap"
}
```

Change `src/index.js` (for React 16+):

```js
import { hydrate, render } from 'react-dom';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
if (rootElement.hasChildNodes()) {
  hydrate(<App />, rootElement);
} else {
  render(<App />, rootElement);
}
```

That's it!

## Basic usage with Vue.js


Install:

```sh
yarn add --dev react-snap
```

Change `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "postbuild": "react-snap"
},
"reactSnap": {
  "source": "dist"
}
```

`source` - output folder of webpack or any other bundler of your choice

Example: [Switch from prerender-spa-plugin to react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/prerender-spa-plugin/commit/ee73d39b862bc905b44a04c6eaa58e6730957819)

### Caveats

Only works with routing strategies using the HTML5 history API. No hash(bang) URLs.

Vue uses `data-server-rendered` attribute on the root element to mark SSR generated markup. When this attribute is present VDOM rehydrates instead of rendering all from scratch, which can result in a flash.

This is the small hack to fix rehydration problem.

```js
window.snapSaveState = () => {
  document.querySelector('#app').setAttribute('data-server-rendered', 'true')
};
```

`window.snapSaveState` is a callback to save a state of the application at the end of rendering. It can be used for Redux or async components. In this example it is repurposed to change DOM, this is why I call it "hack". Maybe in future versions of `react-snap` I will come up with better abstractions or automate this process.

### Vue 1.x

Make sure to use [`replace: false`](https://v1.vuejs.org/api/#replace) for root components

- [stereobooster/an-almost-static-stack](https://github.com/stereobooster/an-almost-static-stack)

## ⚙️ Customization

If you need to pass some options for `react-snap`, you can do this in the `package.json`, like this:

```json
"reactSnap": {
  "inlineCss": true
}
```

All options are not documented yet, but you can check `defaultOptions` in `index.js`.

### Sitemap

If you want to generate a `sitemap.xml` for your static website you can do this in the `package.json`, like this:

```json
"homepage": "https://mycoolwebsite.com/",
"reactSnap": {
  "sitemap": true
}
```

Without the `homepage` a sitemap can't be generated.

### inlineCss

Experimental feature - requires improvements.

`react-snap` can inline critical CSS with the help of [minimalcss](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss) and full CSS will be loaded in a nonblocking manner with the help of [loadCss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fg-loadcss).

Use `inlineCss: true` to enable this feature.

TODO: as soon as the feature will be stable it should be enabled by default.

## ⚠️ Caveats

### Async components

Also known as [code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/), [dynamic import](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (TC39 proposal), "chunks" (which are loaded on demand), "layers", "rollups", or "fragments". See: [Guide To JavaScript Async Components](https://github.com/stereobooster/guide-to-async-components)

Async component (in React) is a technique (typically implemented as a Higher Order Component) for loading components with dynamic `import`. There are a lot of solutions in this field. Here are some examples:

- [`loadable-components`](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components)
- [`react-loadable`](https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable)
- [`react-async-component`](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-async-component)
- [`react-code-splitting`](https://github.com/didierfranc/react-code-splitting)

It is not a problem to render async component with react-snap, tricky part happens when prerendered React application boots and async components are not loaded yet, so React draws "loading" state of a component, later when component loaded react draws actual component. As the result - user sees a flash.

```
100%                    /----|    |----
                       /     |    |
                      /      |    |
                     /       |    |
                    /        |____|
  visual progress  /
                  /
0%  -------------/
```

`react-loadable` and `loadable-components` solve this issue for SSR. But only `loadable-components` can solve this issue for "snapshot" setup:

```js
import { loadComponents } from "loadable-components";
import { getState } from "loadable-components";
window.snapSaveState = () => getState();

loadComponents().then(() => {
  hydrate(AppWithRouter, rootElement);
});
```

### Redux

See: [Redux Server Rendering Section](https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ServerRendering.html#the-client-side)

```js
// Grab the state from a global variable injected into the server-generated HTML
const preloadedState = window.__PRELOADED_STATE__

// Allow the passed state to be garbage-collected
delete window.__PRELOADED_STATE__

// Create Redux store with initial state
const store = createStore(counterApp, preloadedState || initialState)

// Tell react-snap how to save Redux state
window.snapSaveState = () => ({
  "__PRELOADED_STATE__": store.getState()
});
```

**Caution**: as of now only basic "JSON" data types are supported e.g. Date, Set, Map, NaN **won't** be handled right ([#54](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/issues/54)).

### Third-party requests: Google Analytics, Mapbox etc.

You can block all third-party requests with the following config

```
"skipThirdPartyRequests": true
```

### AJAX

`react-snap` can capture all AJAX requests. It will store `json` request to the same domain in `window.snapStore[<path>]`, where `<path>` is the path of json request.

Use `cacheAjaxRequests: true` to enable this feature.

### Service Workers

By default `create-react-app` uses `index.html` as fallback:

```js
navigateFallback: publicUrl + '/index.html',
```

you need to change this to an unprerendered version of `index.html` - `200.html`, otherwise you will see a flash of `index.html` on other pages (if you have any). See [Configure sw-precache without ejecting](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/blob/master/doc/recipes.md#configure-sw-precache-without-ejecting) for more information.

### Containers and other restricted environments

Puppeteer (headless chrome) may fail due to sandboxing issues. To get around this,
you may use

```
"puppeteerArgs": ["--no-sandbox", "--disable-setuid-sandbox"]
```

Read more about [puppeteer troubleshooting.](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md)

`"inlineCss": true` sometimes cause problems in containers

#### Docker + Alpine

To run `react-snap` inside `docker` with Alpine, you might want to use custom chromium executable. See [#93](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/issues/93#issuecomment-354994505) and [#132](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/issues/132#issuecomment-362333702)

#### Heroku

```
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/jontewks/puppeteer-heroku-buildpack.git
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static.git
```

See this [PR](https://github.com/stereobooster/an-almost-static-stack/pull/7/files). At the moment of writing, Heroku doesn't support HTTP2.

### Semantic UI

[Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) is defined over class substrings that contain spaces
(eg. "three column"). Sorting the class names therefore breaks the styling. To get around this,
use the following configuration:

```
"minifyHtml": { "sortClassName": false }
```

### JSS

> Once JS on the client is loaded, components initialized and your JSS styles are regenerated, it's a good time to remove server-side generated style tag in order to avoid side-effects
>
> https://github.com/cssinjs/jss/blob/master/docs/ssr.md

This is basically mean that JSS doesn't support `rehydration`. See [#99](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/issues/99) for possible solutions.

# react-snap [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-snap.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snap) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/react-snap.svg) [![Hacker News](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hacker%20News-Y-orange.svg)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15553863)

Pre-renders web app into static HTML. Uses headless chrome to pre-render. Crawls all available links starting from the root. Heavily inspired by [prep](https://github.com/graphcool/prep) and [react-snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot), but written from scratch. Uses best practices to get best loading performance.

**Does not depend on React**. The name is inspired by `react-snapshot` and because the initial goal was to enable seamless integration with `create-react-app`. Actually, it works with any technology. Considering to change the name.

## Features

- Enables SEO (google, duckduckgo...) and SMO (twitter, facebook...) for SPA.
- Works out-of-the-box with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) - no code-changes required.
- Uses real browser behind the scene, so no issue with unsupported HTML5 features, like WebGL or Blobs.
- Crawls all pages starting from the root, no need to list pages by hand, like in `prep`.
- With prerendered HTML and inlined critical CSS you will get fast first paint, like with [critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical).
- With `Preload resources` feature you will get faster first interaction time if your page does do AJAX requests.
- [Works with webpack 2 code splitting feature](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/issues/5)
- [Handles sourcemaps](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/issues/4)

Please note: some features are experimental, but basic prerendering is considered stable enough. API is subject to change before freeze in version `1.0`.

## Basic usage with create-react-app

Install:

```sh
yarn add --dev react-snap
```

Change `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "react-scripts build && react-snap"
}
```

Change `src/index.js` (for React 16+):

```js
import { hydrate, render } from 'react-dom';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
if (rootElement.hasChildNodes()) {
  hydrate(<App />, rootElement);
} else {
  render(<App />, rootElement);
}
```

That's it!

### Inline css

Experimental feature - requires improvements.

`react-snap` can inline critical CSS with the help of [minimalcss](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss) and full CSS will be loaded in a nonblocking manner with the help of [loadCss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fg-loadcss).

Use `inlineCss: true` to enable this feature.

TODO: as soon as the feature will be stable it should be enabled by default. As of now `<noscript>` fallback not implemented.

### Preload resources

Experimental feature - requires improvements.

`react-snap` can capture all required resources on the page and modify HTML, to instruct a browser to preload those resources.
- It will use `<link rel="preload" as="image">` for images.
- it will store `json` request to the same domain in `window.snapStore[<path>]`, where `<path>` is the path of json request

Use `preloadResources: true` to enable this feature.

## Recipes

See [recipes](Recipes.md) for more examples.

## Caveats

### Google Analytics, Mapbox, and other third-party requests

You can block all third-party requests with the following config

```
"skipThirdPartyRequests": false
```

### WebGL

Headless chrome does not fully support WebGL, if you need render it you can use

```
"headless": false
```

### Webpack 2+ and dynamic import

If you get following error `Uncaught ReferenceError: webpackJsonp is not defined`, you can use the following hack

```
"fixWebpackChunksIssue": true
"chunkRegexp": "([\\d]+)\\.[\\w]{8}\\.chunk\\.js", // default
```

TODO: as soon as the feature will be stable it should be enabled by default.

### Error stack trace in production build

If you get an error in a production build, you can use sourcemaps to decode stack trace:

```
"sourceMaps": true
```

TODO: as soon as the feature will be stable it should be enabled by default.

## TODO

- Fail if any page fails
- Handle minimalcss failures
- Check if `200.html` is present in target directory and exit with error if it is already there
- remove `preloadResources: true`: instead change it to `cacheAjaxRequests: true`
- remove `preloadResources: true`, instead create separate config to preload images, and preload only visible (need to detect if images are actually visible). This would make sense if you use something like LQIP with lazy-loading for images. What about fonts?
- [minimalcss path URL resolution error](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss/pull/28)
- Improve [preconnect](http://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-preconnect), [dns-prefetch](http://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-dns-prefetch) functionality, maybe use [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content). Example: load in small screen - capture all assets, add with a media query for the small screen, load in big screen add the rest of the assets with a media query for the big screen.
- [Decide what is the optimal strategy for chunks](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot/issues/66#issuecomment-338923985). Use link [preload](http://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-preload) or script tag with async
- Do not load assets, the same way as minimalcss does
- Check deployments to [now](https://zeit.co/now#features)
- Check deployments to [surge](https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge)
- Evaluate [penthouse](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse) as alternative to [minimalcss](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss)

# react-snap [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-snap.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snap) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/react-snap.svg) [![Hacker News](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hacker%20News-Y-orange.svg)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15553863)

Pre-renders web app into static HTML. Uses headless chrome to pre-render. Crawls all available links starting from the root. Heavily inspired by [prep](https://github.com/graphcool/prep) and [react-snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot), but written from scratch. Uses best practices to get best loading performance.

**Does not depend on React**. The name is inspired by `react-snapshot` and because the initial goal was to enable seamless integration with `create-react-app`. Actually, it works with any technology. Considering to change the name.

## Features

- Enables SEO (google, duckduckgo...) and SMO (twitter, facebook...) for SPA.
- Works out-of-the-box with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) - no code-changes required.
- Uses real browser behind the scene, so no issue with unsupported HTML5 features, like WebGL or Blobs.
- Crawls all pages starting from the root, no need to list pages by hand, like in `prep`.
- With prerendered HTML and inlined critical CSS you will get fast first paint, like with [critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical).
- With `precacheAjax` feature you will get faster first interaction time if your page does do AJAX requests.
- Works with webpack 2 code splitting feature, but with caveats. See below.
- [Handles sourcemaps](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/issues/4)
- Supports non-root paths (e.g. for create-react-app relative paths)

Please note: some features are experimental, but prerendering is considered stable enough.

## Basic usage with create-react-app

Install:

```sh
yarn add --dev react-snap
```

Change `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "react-scripts build && react-snap"
}
```

Change `src/index.js` (for React 16+):

```js
import { hydrate, render } from 'react-dom';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
if (rootElement.hasChildNodes()) {
  hydrate(<App />, rootElement);
} else {
  render(<App />, rootElement);
}
```

That's it!

### Customization

If you need to pass some options for `react-snap`, you can do this in the `package.json`, like this:

```json
"reactSnap": {
  "inlineCss": true
}
```

All options are not documented yet, but you can check `defaultOptions` in `index.js`.

### inlineCss

Experimental feature - requires improvements.

`react-snap` can inline critical CSS with the help of [minimalcss](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss) and full CSS will be loaded in a nonblocking manner with the help of [loadCss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fg-loadcss).

Use `inlineCss: true` to enable this feature.

TODO: as soon as the feature will be stable it should be enabled by default.

### precacheAjax

Experimental feature - requires improvements.

`react-snap` can capture all AJAX requests. It will store `json` request to the same domain in `window.snapStore[<path>]`, where `<path>` is the path of json request.

Use `precacheAjax: true` to enable this feature.

## ✨ Recipes

See [recipes](Recipes.md) for more examples.

## ⚠️ Caveats

### Code splitting, dynamic import, React async components etc.

> Webpack has a feature to split your codebase into “chunks” which are loaded on demand. Some other bundlers call them “layers”, “rollups”, or “fragments”. This feature is called “code splitting”.
>
> — [Code splitting](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html)

[Dynamic import](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) is the the TC39 proposal.

React async component is a technique (typically a higher order component) for loading components with dynamic imports. There are a lot of solutions in this field here are some examples:

- [`loadable-components`](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components)
- [`react-async-component`](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-async-component)
- [`react-loadable`](https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable)
- [`react-code-splitting`](https://github.com/didierfranc/react-code-splitting)

It is not a problem to render async component with react-snap, tricky part happens when prerendered React application boots and async components are not loaded yet, so React draws loading state of component, later when component loaded react draws actual component. As the result user sees flash.

```

~~I found only one working solution for this problem: [`loadable-components`](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components/).~~ There is no solution for this so far. You will need to change your code a bit:

`index.js`:
```js
import { loadComponents } from "loadable-components";

if (rootElement.hasChildNodes()) {
  window.bootReactSnapApp = () => {
    loadComponents().then(() => {
      hydrate(<App />, rootElement);
    });
  };
} else {
  render(<App />, rootElement);
}
```

`package.json`:
```json
"reactSnap": {
  "asyncComponentsTrick": true
}
```

### Google Analytics, Mapbox, and other third-party requests

You can block all third-party requests with the following config

```
"skipThirdPartyRequests": true
```

### WebGL

Headless chrome does not fully support WebGL, if you need render it you can use

```
"headless": false
```

### Containers and other restricted environments

Puppeteer (headless chrome) may fail due to sandboxing issues. To get around this,
you may use

```
"puppeteerArgs": ["--no-sandbox", "--disable-setuid-sandbox"]
```

Read more about [puppeteer troubleshooting.](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md)

### Error stack trace in production build

If you get an error in a production build, you can use sourcemaps to decode stack trace:

```
"sourceMaps": true
```

TODO: as soon as the feature will be stable it should be enabled by default.

## TODO

- Update [recipes](Recipes.md) based on the code of [stereobooster/an-almost-static-stack](https://github.com/stereobooster/an-almost-static-stack)
- Improve [preconnect](http://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-preconnect), [dns-prefetch](http://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-dns-prefetch) functionality, maybe use [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content). Example: load in small screen - capture all assets, add with a media query for the small screen, load in big screen add the rest of the assets with a media query for the big screen.
- Do not load assets, the same way as minimalcss does
- Evaluate [penthouse](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse) as alternative to [minimalcss](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss)

## Alternatives

- [Webcomponents SSR](https://youtu.be/yT-EsESAmgA)
- [prerender/prerender](https://github.com/prerender/prerender)
- [Simple express server for your Create React App projects with Server-side rendering and Code-splitting](https://github.com/antonybudianto/cra-universal). It seems it is similar to [razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle) - two webpack configs.
